# PomsDependenciesVersionComparer
Searches for pom.xml files in a given directory, parses, links related projects to each other, and generates a summary table with dependencies for each project and its version.

Can be useful if there are multiple Maven projects that may use the same framework and libraries. For timely updates of libraries in other similar projects.

This script doesn't require maven installed and works offline.
